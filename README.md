# Networking Design Project
Design of a Campus Area Network, including cost analysis

The purpose of this project is to design network for a small campus using the information gathered throughout the networking course, along with the CCNA guide and several online websites as references. The Campus Area Network (CAN) design was put together with several key factors in mind, namely high quality, efficient cost, and capacity for potential future upgrades (specifically accommodation for a greater number of users and newer technology).

The campus includes 5 buildings, each with its own unique features and requirements. These buildings include a: Classroom Building, Dorm Building, Administration, Library Learning Center, and Student Union Building. The CAN is designed and tailored to perfectly fit the requirements of each building, with the aforementioned goals in mind, and deliver to the client the best result possible.
